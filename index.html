            <h1> Hello, my name is Mary Mutuku</h1>
            My love for technology comes drom the fact that technology has the ability to impact lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind.
            The idea that something I create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology.</p>
